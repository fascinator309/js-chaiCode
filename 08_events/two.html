<!-- 
 # javascript basic
        by default 
            -> sychrononus ( mode of running code )-> means line by line (top to bottom )

            -> single threaded -> so it is slow in execution but only vanialla js engine , doesn't use any where bcz of single threaded , everywhere(i.e browser , node js) js use in Runtime environment . that make it fast .... chrome runtime environemnt(engine) is V8 (also in all chromiunm based browers)

    blocking code -> sync way -exectue line by line , block the flow to program i.e for receving data in file reading
    non - blocking code -> Asnc way - does not block  

    task queue -> this is in runtime env, make js as aync and fast
    

    setTimeOut(function , time in milisec ) :- after provided time run function only once 
    not core js concept , provide by runtime env/broswer

    setInterval() -> run in every time interval

    in js - handler , callback , function are almost same time .
